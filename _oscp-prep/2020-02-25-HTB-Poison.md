Navigating to the webpage gives a fairly basic page, listing some PHP pages, and a field to insert a file to test.

Additional web directory search with `dirsearch` found no additional directories or files.

## Initial Shell

### LFI on PHP test page

When we put in the first test file in the list, `ini.php`, we're redirected to the contents of the file. Not much interesting besides a few directory names here. However, that URL parameter looks like a great spot for an LFI. By the way, viewing the source on these pages makes them much more readable.

![](/assets/htb-poison/possible_lfi.png)

We can test this by inserting `/etc/passwd` into the `file` parameter in the URL. Sure enough, we have a solid LFI here, that can read out files on the server. From the output of `/etc/passwd`, we can see that we have a username of `charix`.

### Cracking base64 encoded password

As interesting as the LFI is, we should keep looking at the other listed PHP files.

The `info.php` file gives a `uname -a` readout, containing the OS and kernel info.

![](/assets/htb-poison/info_php.png)

When we open `listfiles.php`, we get another nice surprise. The `pwdbackup.txt` file looks to be in the same location as the PHP files we've been looking at, and should be accessible via the LFI we found.

![](/assets/htb-poison/listfiles_php.png)

Pulling up the `pwdbackup.txt` file in the LFI gives us this block of text.

```
This password is secure, it's encoded atleast 13 times.. what could go wrong really..

```

Interesting. It seems they base64 encoded a password, and repeated it at least 13 times to better obfucate it. Let's break it down. I saved the base64 text to a file called `b64.pass`, and used the below command to iterate thorugh it.

```bash
data=$(cat b64.pass); for i in $(seq 1 13); do data=$(echo $data | tr -d ' ' | base64 -d); done; echo $data
```

Running the command gives us a password of `Charix!2#4%6&8(0`.

![](/assets/htb-poison/charix_pw.png)

We can now use this password on the SSH server as `charix`.

![](/assets/htb-poison/ssh_charix.png)

We can read `user.txt` from `/home/charix/user.txt`

## Privilege Escalation

### Secret.zip file

When we look in the `/home/charix` directory, we can see the `secret.zip` file.

![](/assets/htb-poison/secretzip.png)

After transferring it locally, we can try to unzip it, but it seems it requires a password.

![](/assets/htb-poison/secretzip_pwneeded.png)

Before jumping into cracking the ZIP, let's just try to reuse the password for the `charix` account that we already have.

![](/assets/htb-poison/secret_unzip.png)

It worked! It seems the ZIP contained another file called `secret`, which looks to be a small binary file of some sort. Not really useful right now, but let's keep it in mind.

### TightVNC Service

In our enumeration, the `ps -aux` command reveals that there is a TightVNC service running as `root`.

![](/assets/htb-poison/xvnc_service_psaux.png)

A look at `netstat -an` reveals that indeed, it's running on local ports 5801/5901, which is why we didn't see them with our initial enumeration.

![](/assets/htb-poison/netstat.png)

Since these are local ports, we can use our existing SSH credentials as `charix` to open an SSH tunnel for connection to them using our local machine.

The command `ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 charix@10.10.10.84` will open a new SSH connection, that will forward all traffic from port 5901 on our machine, to port 5901 on the target machine.

So remember that `secret` file we unzipped? We can use it as a credential for VNC. The below command will open a VNC session using the forwarded port, and captured credential.

```
vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5901 -passwd secret
```

![](/assets/htb-poison/tightvnc_connections.png)

We can read `root.txt` at `/root/root.txt`.
